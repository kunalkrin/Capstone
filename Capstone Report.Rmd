## Background and Problem Statement
PASSNYC -- a not-for-profit organization that facilitates a collective impact-- is dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City's talented and underserved students. New York City is home to some of the most impressive educational institutions in the world, yet in recent years, the City's specialized high schools - institutions with historically transformative impact on student outcomes - have seen a shift toward more homogeneous student body demographics.

PASSNYC uses public data to identify students within New York City's under-performing school districts and, through consulting and collaboration with partners, aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). By focusing efforts in under-performing areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, we will help pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.

With limited time and resources, PASSNYC must be strategic in systemically improving the diversity pipeline and social mobility of certain disadvantaged groups into the specialized schools. The main question to be answered is where will PASSNYC's investment produce the greatest ROI for the services they offer (after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents)?

## Data Cleaning

### Loading Libraries and Data
Let's load some libraries we will use.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
library(reshape)
source("http://www.sthda.com/upload/rquery_cormat.r")
```


Let's load our data from the table:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include= T , paged.print= F}
reg <- read_csv("D5 SHSAT Registrations and Testers.csv")
school <- read_csv("2016 School Explorer.csv")
```

Before we proceed, let's take a look at the initial data.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include= T , paged.print= F}
head(reg)

head(school)
```

Our data looks pretty clean by most standards, but there is work to be done for sure. For example, we'll need to rename some of our variable names, join our two tables, etc. Let's move forward with some cleaning.
 
In order to make our data analysis easier, let's start cleaning the data. Let's begin by focusing on `reg`.

### Reg
We begin by renaming the columns we plan to use.


```{r include=FALSE}
#Let's start by renaming the columns to make them easier for us and R to understand.
reg<- reg %>%
  rename(school = `School name`,
         year = `Year of SHST`,
         grade = `Grade level`,
         enroll = `Enrollment on 10/31`,
         registered = `Number of students who registered for the SHSAT`,
         took = `Number of students who took the SHSAT`)

#Finding the average number of students at each school, how many registered, and how many took the test
reg<- reg %>%
  group_by(school) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, mean) %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, funs(paste(unique(.), collapse = "_"))) %>%
  distinct()


reg$school<-toupper(reg$school)

#Let's remove some columns that have no use for our future analysis.
reg<-reg %>%
  select(-year )%>%
  select(-grade)


#Calculating percentages of those who registered of the total population, registered AND took the test, and those who took the test of the total population
reg<-reg%>%
  mutate(regPct = registered/enroll)%>%
  mutate(tookPct = took/enroll)%>%
  mutate(yield = took/registered)


#What does the table currently look like?
head(reg)


#Let's clean up the other sheet
school<-read_csv("2016 School Explorer.csv")

#what does the table look like?
head (school)

#remove unneccessary columns
school<-school%>%
  select(-`Adjusted Grade`)%>%
  select(-`New?`)%>%
  select(-`Other Location Code in LCGMS`)%>%
  select(-`SED Code`)%>%
  select(-starts_with('Grade'))

#renaming some columns
head(school)

school<- school %>%
  rename(school = `School Name`,
         address = `Address (Full)`,
         DBN = `Location Code`, 
         lat =  Latitude,
         long = Longitude,
         zip = Zip,
         eni = `Economic Need Index`,
         district = District,
         commSchool = `Community School?`,
         income = `School Income Estimate`,
         pctELL = `Percent ELL`,
         pctAsian = `Percent Asian`,
         pctBlack = `Percent Black`,
         pctBlackHispanic = `Percent Black / Hispanic`,
         pctHispanic = `Percent Hispanic`,
         pctWhite = `Percent White`,
         pctAttend = `Student Attendance Rate`,
         pctAbsentChronic = `Percent of Students Chronically Absent`,
         pctRigor = `Rigorous Instruction %`,
         ratingRigor = `Rigorous Instruction Rating`,
         pctCollab = `Collaborative Teachers %`,
         ratingCollab = `Collaborative Teachers Rating`,
         pctSupp = `Supportive Environment %`,
         ratingSupp = `Supportive Environment Rating`,
         pctLeader = `Effective School Leadership %`,
         ratingLeader = `Effective School Leadership Rating`,
         pctCommunity = `Strong Family-Community Ties %`,
         ratingCommunity = `Strong Family-Community Ties Rating`,
         pctTrust = `Trust %`,
         ratingTrust = `Trust Rating`,
         avgELA = `Average ELA Proficiency`,
         avgMath = `Average Math Proficiency`)
         

#now we want to join the tables together
school_clean <- full_join(school, reg, by = "DBN" )

#changing some columns to numeric values (as they should be)

school_clean<- school_clean %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(contains('pct')),funs(as.numeric(gsub("%", "", ., fixed = TRUE))/100)) %>%
  mutate(income = as.numeric(gsub('\\$|,', '', income))) %>%
  mutate(eni = as.numeric(eni))%>%
  mutate(avgELA = as.numeric(avgELA),
         avgMath = as.numeric(avgMath))

#making some final touches on our new table
school_clean <- school_clean%>%
  filter(!is.na(school.x))%>%
  select(-school.y)%>%
  rename(school = school.x)

#let's turn some qualitative ratings into quantitative scores. First, let's create a function to make creating these new columns easier.
quantScore <- function(x){
  if_else(grepl("Not Meeting Target", x),1 ,
          if_else(grepl("Approaching Target", x),2 ,
                  if_else(grepl("Meeting Target", x),3 , 
                          if_else(grepl("Exceeding Target", x), 4, 0))))
  
}

school_clean<- school_clean%>%
  mutate(quantRigor = quantScore(ratingRigor)) %>%
  mutate(quantCollab = quantScore(ratingCollab)) %>%
  mutate(quantSupp = quantScore(ratingSupp)) %>%
  mutate(quantLeader = quantScore(ratingLeader)) %>%
  mutate(quantCommunity = quantScore(ratingCommunity)) %>%
  mutate(quantTrust = quantScore(ratingTrust))


write_csv(school_clean, "SHSAT_data.csv")


str(school_clean)

			
numeric<- na.omit(school_clean)


numeric%>%
  select(eni, income, yield, enroll, regPct, tookPct, starts_with('pct'), starts_with('avg'), starts_with('quant'))%>%
  cor() %>%
  corrplot(type = "upper")  

race<- lm(avgMath ~ eni, data = school_clean)
summary(race)
plot(race)
         
```         



Before continuing, there are three things we need to consider when analyzing our data:

* PassNYC cares about increasing diversity; therefore need to look at low income, and underrepresented racial minorities (URM) students
* PassNYC wants to improve the situation through their offerings: after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, and resources for parents
* Success will be measured by how many student register then take the test, as well as the academic performance of the school as an indicator.







## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r echo=F}
ggpairs(school_clean, columns = 11:17)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
g <- ggplot(school_clean, aes( as.factor(district), eni))
g + geom_violin() + 
  labs(title="ENI of NY School Districts", 
       x= "District",
       y="Economic Need Index")
```
