# An introduction to the problem (based on your earlier Capstone submissions).

PASSNYC -- a not-for-profit organization that facilitates a collective impact-- is dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City's talented and underserved students. New York City is home to some of the most impressive educational institutions in the world, yet in recent years, the City's specialized high schools - institutions with historically transformative impact on student outcomes - have seen a shift toward more homogeneous student body demographics.

PASSNYC uses public data to identify students within New York City's under-performing school districts and, through consulting and collaboration with partners, aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). By focusing efforts in under-performing areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, we will help pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.

With limited time and resources, PASSNYC must be strategic in systemically improving the diversity pipeline and social mobility of certain disadvantaged groups into the specialized schools. The main question to be answered is where will PASSNYC's investment produce the greatest ROI for the services they offer (after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents)?
